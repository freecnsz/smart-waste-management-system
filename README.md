# Smart Waste Management System

## Overview
The Smart Waste Management System is a project aimed at optimizing waste collection processes, reducing resource wastage, and minimizing environmental impact through the use of IoT technology. This system incorporates sensor technology, data analytics, and predictive maintenance algorithms to efficiently manage waste collection and disposal.

## Project Objectives
- Monitor fill levels of waste bins in real-time using sensor technology.
- Optimize waste collection routes based on fill levels and other factors using data analytics.
- Implement predictive maintenance algorithms to prevent overflow incidents and optimize resource usage.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for waste management personnel to monitor bin fill levels, view optimized collection routes, and schedule maintenance tasks.

## Components
The project consists of the following components:
- Hardware components: Ultrasonic or weight sensors, microcontrollers, communication modules.
- Software components: Data analytics algorithms, user interface applications, backend systems, and database management systems.
